# This is a wrapper script for the java program actoshape.jar.  In
# most cases it will work as written, with no modifications, as long
# as the file "actoshape.jar" is in the same directory where this
# script is.
#
# If you want to install this script in some directory other than the
# one containing actoshape.jar, or if for some other reason this
# script isn't able to find actoshape.jar when you run it, change the
# following line to reference the full pathname of the directory
# containing actoshape.jar, and remove the comment character from the
# beginning of the line:
#ACTOSHAPE_HOME=/directory/containing/actoshape/jar
