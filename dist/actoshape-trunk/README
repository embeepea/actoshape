   Copyright (c) 2009  University of North Carolina at Asheville


This directory contains version trunk of "actoshape", a
program for generating shapefiles from ADCIRC output files.  Actoshape
is a shell script which is intended to be invoked from the command
line; it is a wrapper for a java program that is contained in the file
"actoshape.jar".  Java must be installed on your system (version 1.5
or higher) in order for actoshape to work.

Documentation is in the file "actoshape.man".

You should be able to invoke "actoshape" from the command-line by
giving either a relative or absolute path to its location in this
directory.  Note that by default, the "actoshape.jar" file should be
located in the same directory where the "actoshape" script is.  If you
want to install the "actoshape" script someplace else, or if you get
an error message indicating that "actoshape.jar" cannot be found when
you run "actoshape", open "actoshape" in an editor and modify it
according to the comments at the top of the file.

Actoshape comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.  It is Free Software
and may be used under the terms of the RENCI Open Source Software
License, a copy of which is available in the file LICENSE.txt.

If you use actoshape in your project or publication, please
give credit to the author.
